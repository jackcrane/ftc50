# The Reasonable Expectation of Success

The reasonable expectation of success is one of the most important fundamental rules in FTC. This is not an official term, but is descriptive.

There have been several situations when the Reasonable Expectation of Success has been violated at tournaments and has never worked out well for the offending team. Lately, a team was accused of underperforming purposefully during a qualification match in an attempt to tank their alliance partner's stats. You cannot do that. You are expected to perform to the best of your ability during every match, practice run, and anything else at a competition.
