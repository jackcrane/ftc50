# Introduction

## What _is_ FTC50?

FTC50, named following the collegiate naming convention, is the most basics for you to get a grasp of what to expect going into an FTC season, and detailed instructions on how to deal with everything from forming a team, to dealing with teammates, leadership, technical skills, building, programming, strategy, and more.

## This sounds familiar

We love GM0 too! It is an incredible resource, and much of the information availible is listed on both sites.

### So if the format is similar to GM0, the content is similar to GM0, why bother writing this?

This project was started by a senior with a true passion for FIRST robotics, and I am writing this mostly to my team, as a way to share the knowledge and experience I have gained, and as a reference document on how to handle anything a season can throw at you.

We differ from GM0 in that this is often an opinionated document. I am sharing what has worked and what has not worked for me. Obviously take what is in here with a mild grain of salt. Most of the content in here is from a great deal of testing, but your mileage may vary. For example, I will say GoBilda's 5202 series motors are the best motors for FTC. This is not an educated opinion, but many teams like to use Andymark's NeveRest motors and see great success.

## Why should I trust you?

(I do not mean to be arrogant or bragging in this section, merely establishing credibility.)

Good question. I got my start on the (admittedly controversial) team 10030, 7 Sigma (and I will discuss many of the dynamics I experienced on that team in the leadership and ethics section). After a year (Relic Recovery) at 7 Sigma, we had won:

- Multiple world record runs
- Detroit World Championship rank 30
- Inspire
- Inspire 2nd
- Winning Alliance Captain
- Winning Alliance 1st Pick
- Think Award
- Design Award Finalist
- Motivate Award Finalist

I then started my current team, 14365 the Summit Knights, and over the 4 years under my leadership, we qualified for the state championship three times, and won:

- Design Award
- Motivate Award
- Innovate Award
- Compass Award
- Ohio Showcase Team
