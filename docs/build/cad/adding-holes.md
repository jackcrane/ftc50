# Adding holes

We have already sketched out the location of each of our holes, so it is as easy as thickening them and calling it a day!

## Cutting the hex hole for the REV Shaft

Activate the thicken tool just as we have done several times now, click the hexagon we created. Change the tool type from 'New' to 'Remove'. For the input 'Direction 1', we want to set it to how deep the hole will go. In this case we want it to go all the way through, so we can set it anything larger or equal to the length of the part we are building. In this case, I am going to cut 25mm deep. Once again, if the extrusion is in the wrong direction, click the arrows next to the distance input box.

Finally, you will see the geometry we just created is red, which means it's invalid. To make it valid, we need to make it merge with all, so check the 'Merge with all' box. Finally, click the green check box to save your work.

## Cutting the scew holes

Just like we did with the hex hole, we want to cut the holes. This time, however, we want to make sure the holes will cut all the way through, so I am going to set the 'Distance 1' to 5 inches. This is an arbitrary number, but the important part is it is larger than anything we will be making in this part.

Select the thicken tool again, but this time instead of selecting the circles in the 3d view, just click on 'Sketch 1' in the left panel. This makes it easier to select multiple shapes to thicken. Be sure to change the tool to 'Remove' again.

Again, make sure the geometry is being added in the right direction, then click 'Merge with all'. Finally, click the green check box to save your work.

## Finished?

Well technically yes. You can now print this model and attach it to your theoretical robot, but there are a handful of important things we havent considered yet, and those are covered in the next page.
