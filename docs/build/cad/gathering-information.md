# Gathering Information for our Design

Again, our project will be an adapter that we can 3d print to adapt GoBilda's pattern to a REV hex shaft. We are hoping to have the gobilda part flat on the `XY` plane, and have the shaft run along the `X` axis.

We need 2 parts of information before we can properly design our adapter. You need the information for the pattern you hope to attach to and the design of the REV shaft.

Each manufacturer has a 'hole pattern' that they use to design their products. These patterns are immensely helpful when staying within the same build system, but if you need to switch between multiple, then it becomes problematic.

## Learning about GoBilda's pattern

Let's visit GoBilda's website, then click 'structure', then 'pattern plates'. If you are familiar with GoBilda you will recognize this pattern. Because the pattern repeats, it really doesn't matter which of the products on this page we select, so for simplicity sake, I will choose the 1x1. (https://www.gobilda.com/1123-series-pattern-plate-1-x-1-hole-48-x-48mm/).

On the product page for this part, there are 2 images: A photo of the actual metal product, and a technical drawing with dimensions baked in. We care about this technical drawing, so we will save this for later (You should keep this browser tab open, but I have also put it in the [references](./references) page of this section).

## Learning about REV's shaft design

Usually, REV has a link to a technical drawing under the Documentation section of the product page on their website, but not in this case because the shaft is such a simple shape, instead they have the OD (outer diameter) under the Specifications section, and we know the the shaft has a 5mm OD.
